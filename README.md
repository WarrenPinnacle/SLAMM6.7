# SLAMM6.7

SLAMM 6 has been moved on to GitHub allowing for dynamic updates of source code, executables, installers, documents, and sample data.

The current code compiles on Embarcadero Delphi XE3.

The code currently requires the Shape Viewer Objects GIS Unit to compile
Copyright(C) 1999-2004 Ecological Software Solutions (ESS).

We are not currently licensed to distribute this software, but it can be downloaded here:

Please contact us with any questions about compilation of this unit.

(It is also possible to compile the code without this unit by removing those
components requiring shapefile integration.)
